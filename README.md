# Smile-Please :smile:
Nowadays, people are smiling very infrequently. It has reached to a point that, we have to watch shows and browse throuh memes to get one genuine smile. So, when I first heard the concept of silly Hacks, my first thought was, why not build something which may make someone smile a little more. When i first started, I thought of making a website or automation to do that, but on second thought, opening an app or website to laugh is quite impractical in a daily life scenario. So, I created Smile Please to tackle that problem. Basically, what the project do is, get random jokes through different API's and displays them in a specific time interval using the windows system notification. you will get your daily dose of laughter, even when you are too busy to smile or do anything.And it also reminds you to drink water and stare away from the screen for a few minutes, because that is also important.
